Functions of a Complex Variable

Complex differentiability
=========================

.. math::
	f: \Bbb C \to \Bbb C

Complex Integrals are more fun
==============================
Lets us evaluate some real integrals e.g.

.. math::
	\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x}dx

3 ways to describe :math:`\Bbb C`:
1. Arithmetically as a real vector space
2. Algebraic closure of :math:`\Bbb R`
3. Geometrically as a real vector space.

.. admonition:: Definition
	
	:math:`z \in \Bbb C` are such that :math:`z=x+iy`, :math:`x,y \in \Bbb R`
	where :math:`i^{2}=-1`.

If :math:`z = x+iy`, 
 * :math:`Re(z):=x`
 * :math:`Im(z):=y`
 * :math:`\bar{z}:=x-iy`

Operations
==========
Addition
--------
group real & imaginary parts

Multiplication
--------------
.. math::
	(x+iy)(a+ib) = xa + ixb + iya - by

				 = xa - yb + i(xb + ya) = (a+ib)(x+iy)

.. note:: multiplication is commutative, as in :math:`\Bbb R`.

Division
--------
.. math::
	\frac{x+iy}{a+ib} = \frac{(x_iy)(a-ib)}{a^2+b^2} 
	= \frac{xa+yb + i(ay - bx)}{a^2+b^2}

The properties of these operations satisfy the field properties.

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
==============================
The polynomial :math:`f(z) = z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} +...+ a_1 z + a_0` factors completely under :math:`\Bbb C`

.. admonition:: Definition

	A field :math:`\Bbb F` is algebraically closed if every polynomial over :math:`\Bbb F` factors completely. :math:`\Bbb C` is the smallest such field for :math:`\Bbb R`; it is its **algebraic closure**.
