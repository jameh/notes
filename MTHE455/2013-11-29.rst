- Question 1 on Branching Processes
  
  - Concerns probability of ultimate extinction
- Question 2 on Discrete-Time Markov Chains
- Question 3 on the Poisson Process
- Question 4 on Continuous-Time Markov Chains
  
  - Will require calculation of stationary distribution for the process and for the embedded jump chain.
- Question 5 related to the Poisson process...

.. admonition:: Example (Q1: Branching Process)

    .. admonition:: Recall

        The extinction probability is the smallest solution to :math:`η=G(η)`, where :math:`G` is the family size generating function.

    Suppose family size is :math:`Geometric(p)` on :math:`\{0,1,2,...\}`:

    .. math::
        P(\text{family size is }k)=pq^k

    where :math:`q=1-p`, for :math:`k=0,1,2,...`

    Suppose each child born survives with probability :math:`r`, and does not survive to the next generation with probability :math:`1-r`

    Let :math:`X` be the number of offspring of any given individual that make it to next generation.

    .. math::
        P(X=k)=\sum_{n=k}^\infty P(X=k|Y=n)pq^n

    where :math:`Y\sim Geometric(p)`

    .. math::
        P(X=k)=\sum_{n=k}^\infty {n choose k}r^k(1-r)^{n-k}pq^n

    For the extinction probability, we want the generating function of :math:`X`:

    .. math::
        G_X(s)&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty s^kP(X=k)\\
            &=\sum_{k=0}^\infty s^k\sum_{n=k}^\infty {n choose k}r^k(1-r)^{n-k}pq^n\\
            &=\sum_{n=0}^\infty pq^n \sum_{k=0}^n {n choose k}(sr)^k(1-r)^{n-k}\\
            &=\sum_{n=0}^\infty pq^n (sr+1-r)^n\\
            &=p\sum_{n=0}^\infty (q(sr+1-r))^n\\
            &=\frac{p}{1-q(sr+1-r)}

    Extinction probability satisfies:

    .. math::
        η=\frac{p}{1-q(ηr+1-r)}

    or

    .. math::
        η(1-q(ηr+1-r))=p\\
        qrη^2 -(1-q(1-r))η+p=0

.. admonition:: Example (2012 Final #4(a))

    Firefly alternates between illuminated and not illuminated. At time :math:`t`, the firefly is illuminated if and only if the most recent event before time :math:`t` in a Poisson process with rate :math:`λ` occured in :math:`[t-1,t]`.

    At time :math:`t`, what is the probability that the firefly is illuminated?

    Given :math:`N(t)=n`, the most recent event time is distributed as :math:`max(U_1,...,U_n)`, where the :math:`U_i` are independent :math:`Unif(0,t)` random variables.

    So if :math:`A_t` is the event that the firefly is illuminated at time :math:`t` and :math:`L(t)` is the time of the most recent event before time :math:`t`, then

    .. math::
        P(A_t)&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(A_t | N(t)=n)P(N(t)=n)\\
            &=\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(L(t)\in [t-1,t]|N(t)=n)P(N(t)=n)

    .. math::
        P(L(t)in [t-1,t]|N(t)=n) &= P(max(U_1,...,U_n)\geq t-1)\\
            &=1-P(max(U_1,...,U_n) < t-1)\\
            &= 1-P(U_1<t-1,...,U_n<t-1)\\
            &=1-\left(\frac{t-1}{t}\right)^n

    So now,

    .. math::
        P(A_t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(1-\left(\frac{t-1}{t}\right)^n\right)\frac{(λt)^n}{n!}e^{-λt}

    ... Taylor series expansion.

.. admonition:: Example (Final Exam 2012 Problem 5(a))

    If a discrete-time Markov chain is time-reversible, then show that the period of any state cannot be greater than 2.

    Suppose :math:`p_{ij}>0` for some :math:`j`. Then :math:`p_{ji}>0` by time reversibility.

    Then :math:`p_{ii}(2)\geq p_{ij}p{ji}>0`. Thus, the period must divide 2. QED
