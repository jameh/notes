Let :math:`\{X_t: t\geq 0\}` be a stochastic process with index set :math:`[0,\infty)`

.. admonition:: Definition

    An *increment* is of the form

    .. math::
        X(t)-X(s), s\geq t

.. admonition:: Definition

    The process :math:`\{X_t: t\geq 0\}` is said to have *stationary increments* if the distribution of :math:`X_t-X_s` depends only on the difference :math:`t-s`.

.. admonition:: Definition

    The process :math:`\{X(t): t\geq 0\}` is said to have independent increments if any two increments  involving disjoint intervals are independent.

.. admonition:: Example

    If :math:`Z_i`, :math:`i=1,2,...` are independent and identically distributed, and :math:`X_n=\sum_{i=1}^nZ_i`, then :math:`\{X_n:n\geq 0\}` has both stationary and independent increments.

    **Poisson Process**

    A continuous-time stochastic process

    .. math::
        \{N(t): t\geq 0\}

    is a Poisson process with rate :math:`λ` if

    i. :math:`N(0)=0`
    ii. It has stationary and independent increments
    iii. The distribution of :math:`N(t)` is Poisson with mean :math:`λt`
    
        .. math::
            P(N(t)=k)=\frac{(λt)^k}{k!}e^{-λt}, && k=0,1,2

From this definition

* For :math:`s<t`, the distribution of :math:`N(t)-N(s)` is the same as the distribution of :math:`N(t-s)-N(0)`, by stationary increments, and since :math:`N(0)=0`, we have

  .. math::
      N(t)-N(s)\sim Poisson(λ(t-s))

* The process is non-decreasing since

  .. math::
      N(t)-N(s)\sim Poisson(λ(t-s))\geq 0

  with probability 1
* The sample space of the Poisson process is :math:`S=\{0,1,2,...\}`

Landau's "Little oh" Notation
=============================
The notation :math:`o(h)` is called "little oh of h", and does not refer to any specific function

It specifies any function of :math:`h` that goes to 0 at a faster rate than :math:`h`, as :math:`h\to 0`.

In other words, :math:`\frac{o(h)}{h}\to 0` as :math:`h\to 0`.

We get things like

.. math::
          o(h)+o(h)&=o(h)\\
           o(h)o(h)&=o(h)\\
        c\cdot o(h)&=o(h)

where :math:`c` is any constant

.. admonition:: Example

    :math:`h^k` is :math:`o(h)` for any :math:`k>1`

    .. math::
        \sum_{k=2}^\infty c_k h^k\text{ with }|c_k|<1 && \forall k

    is :math:`o(h)`

.. admonition:: Definition

    Poisson Process (def 2)

    A continuous time process :math:`\{N(t):t\geq 0\}` is a Poisson process with rate :math:`λ>0` if

    i. :math:`N(0)=0`
    ii. It has stationary and independent increments
    iii. The probabilities:

      .. math::
               P(N(h)=1)&=λh+o(h)\\
           P(N(h)\geq 2)&=o(h)\\
               P(N(h)=0)&=1-λh+o(h)

Let us show that the first definition implies this definition.

First, note that :math:`N(h)\sim Poisson(λh)`

So

.. math::
    P(N(h)=0)&=e^{-λh}\\
             &=1-λh+\frac{(λh)^2}{2}-\frac{(λh)^3}{3!}+...\\
             &=1-λh+o(h)

Also,

.. math::
    P(N(h)=1)&=λhe^{-λh}\\
             &=λh-λ^2h^2+\frac{(λh)^3}{2}-\frac{(λh)^3}{3!}+...\\
             &=λh+o(h)

By subtraction,

.. math::
    P(N\geq 2)&=1-(λh+o(h))-(1-λh+o(h))\\
              &=o(h)
