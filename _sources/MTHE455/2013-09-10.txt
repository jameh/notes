Time Homogeneity
****************

.. admonition:: Definition

	A stochastic process is *time-homogenous* if:

	.. math::
		P(X_n = j | X_m = i) = P(X_{n+k} = j | X_{m+k} = i)

	for all :math:`i`, :math:`j \in S` and for all :math:`m \leq n`.

The simple symmetric random walk (from last lecture) is time-homogenous.

.. admonition:: Definition

	A stochastic process is *stationary* if:

	:math:`P(X_{t_1} = i_1, ..., X_{t_k} = i_k) = P(X_{t_1}+s = i_1, ..., X_{t_k}+s = i_k)`

	for all times :math:`t_1, ..., t_k` and any :math:`k \geq 1` and any states :math:`i_1, ... i_k`

.. admonition:: Example

	Galton-Watson Branching Process

.. image:: 

We assume that the family size distribution on :math:`\{0,1,2,3,...\}` is the same for all individuals and all family sizes are independent.

Let :math:`Y_{n,k}` be i.i.d random variable, each with family size distribution :math:`n=0,1,2,...`

Let :math:`X_n` be the number of individuals in generation :math:`n`.

.. math::
	X_0 = 1

	X_1 = Y_{0,1}

	X_2 = Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,2}

	...

	X_n = Y_{n-1, 1} + Y_{n-1, 2} + ... + Y_{n-1, X_{n-1}}

This process is time-homogeneous, but not stationary.

.. admonition:: Definition

	A stochastic process is *spatially homogeneous* if

	.. math::
		P(X_1 = i_1, ..., X_n = i_n) = P(X_1 + k = i_1, ..., X_n + k = i_n)

Conditional Expectation (a review)
==================================
If :math:`X` and :math:`Y` are discrete random variables, then the expectation of :math:`X` given :math:`Y=y` is:

.. math::
	E[X|Y=y] = \sum_\chi x P(X=x | Y=y)
