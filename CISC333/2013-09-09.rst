   Data Mining
	1. Inductive modelling of systems from data
	2. "Knowledge Discovery"

	  * NSA uses this synonym because "Data Mining" must be reported to Congress

The Data Flood
==============

 	There are more than 3 billion cell phone calls per day. Every call
 	generates at least 1 record.

`Sloan Digital Sky Survey`_ ~ 15.7TB

Scientific Method
=================
The scientific method involves *controlled* experiments. Controlled experiments
are not realistic in many fields, e.g. social, economic, physical, medical.

Instead of *controlled* populations, in data mining we use populations.

We poke and prod at the population and discover relationships that give rise to
**models**.  The problem once we have a set of models is deciding on the best.

There is no notion of deduction in data mining - but there is a similar (weaker)
concept of induction.

Where deduction is purely logical, induction is basically the term we use to say
that our inferences are not based on logic alone.
