   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Jamie's reStructured Notes!

.. note:: An apology to `mitsuhiko`_ for using his Flask theme for these docs,
	even though this project is not Flask related at all.  I plan to make bigger
	style modifications time-permitting.  In the meantime, thanks for the theme, and
	others be warned - this isn't a Flask extension :).

This is a collection of my course notes written up in reStructuredText, compiled
with Sphinx, and hosted on Github pages. I am in 4th year Math & Engineering
in the Computing & Communications option.  Below is an index of my courses this
year.
